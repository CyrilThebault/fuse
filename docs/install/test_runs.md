## Run FUSE for the catchment test case

The steps below will enable you to test if FUSE is running as expected. The instructions below were purposefully kept short, but each element is described in detail in the rest of the documentation.

1. If you haven't yet, download the data for the [catchment test case](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f6omcgz8hsirlr0/fuse_catch.zip?dl=0) to a directory `$(data_catch)`.
1. Update the lines 3 to 5 of `fm_catch.txt` (this is the file manager) using the path of `$(data_catch)`.
1. Run FUSE using default parameter values (note `run_def` below):

```
./fuse.exe path_to_data_catch/fm_catch.txt us_09066300 run_def
```

If FUSE runs and terminates with `Done`, it is good sign. We will make simulations available that you can compare to your own simulations.

## Run FUSE for the grid case study

1. If you haven't yet, download the data for the [grid test case](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f6omcgz8hsirlr0/fuse_catch.zip?dl=0) to a directory `$(data_grid)`.
1. Update the lines 3 to 5 of `fm_grid.txt` (this is the file manager) using the path of the `$(data_grid)`.
1. Run FUSE using default parameter values (note `run_def` below):

```
./fuse.exe path_to_data_grid/fm_grid.txt cesm1-cam5 run_def
```

If FUSE runs and terminates with `Done`, it is good sign. We will make simulations available that you can compare to your own simulations.
