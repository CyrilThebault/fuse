To get you started with FUSE, we provide files for two test cases involving modeling at different spatial scales:

* catchment scale: forcing and streamflow data for the [USGS 09066300 MIDDLE CREEK NEAR MINTURN, CO.](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=09066300&agency_cd=USGS&) catchment - available [here [0.5MB]](

* grid scale: forcing from a climate model on a 1/8th degree grid for a 58 x 28 grid cells domain - available [here [42MB]](
