## Data for two spatial configurations

To get you started with FUSE, we provide data for two test cases. They will enable you to test FUSE in its two spatial configurations: FUSE can be run for an individual catchment or on a grid (see [Execution modes](../../../execution_modes/)).
Download the data for the two test cases in order to [test FUSE](/install/test_runs/).

## Catchment test case

Observed atmospheric forcing and streamflow estimates for the catchment [Middle Creek near Minturn](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=09066300&agency_cd=USGS&) in Colorado, USA  - data available [here [0.5MB]](

## Grid test case

Atmospheric forcing simulated by a climate model on a 1/8th degree grid for a 58 x 28 grid cells domain - data available [here [42MB]](
